## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please open a private issue using the repository's issue tracker at `https://github.com/matanmalka1/mm-backend-core/issues/new?labels=security`. Expect an acknowledgement within 3 business days; if the report is confirmed but needs time to fix, we will send weekly progress updates until the patch lands. If we decline to address a report, we'll explain the reasoning in the issue so you know the status of your submission.
